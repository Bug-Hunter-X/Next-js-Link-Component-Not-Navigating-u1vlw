## Problem
The `Link` component renders visually, but clicking the links produces no navigation.  This often happens due to incorrect usage or interference from other components or styling.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file fixes this issue by ensuring that the `Link` component is used correctly and avoiding common conflicts. This typically involves checking for interference with JavaScript frameworks.
